**Introduction Figure**. Visual illustration of the advantages of employing multispectral (RGB-Thermal) images for semantic segmentation. The complementary nature of RGB and thermal images are highlighted using yellow and green boxes, respectively. The RGB-only method, DeepLabV3+, is susceptible to incorrect segmentation or even missing target objects entirely. In contrast, multispectral segmentation methods, e.g., EGFNet and our ECM method, which incorporate thermal infrared information, effectively identify the segments within the context. Particularly, our results are visually closer to the ground truths compared to the state-of-the-art EGFNet.
